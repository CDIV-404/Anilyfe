# ANILyfe

   ANILyfe is a premium anime-themed marketplace prototype designed for Nigeria-first e-commerce flows, with a futuristic blue-and-white visual language and a marketplace-only structure. The experience is built as a front-end prototype with mock data and localStorage persistence, making it easy to evolve into a real API-driven application later.

   ## Overview

   ANILyfe is not a social platform. It is a marketplace built around the core flow:

   Browse → Discover → Compare → Purchase → Delivery → Review

   The project includes:

   - Landing experience and marketplace storefront
   - Buyer registration and login flows
   - Seller onboarding and seller dashboard scaffolding
   - Product browsing, search, filters, and detail pages
   - Cart, wishlist, and checkout prototypes
   - Admin login and moderation views
   - Help, FAQ, shipping, privacy, returns, contact, and support pages
   - Responsive UI with anime-inspired futuristic styling

   ## Core goals

   - Build a clean, premium e-commerce experience for anime products
   - Keep the app strictly marketplace-focused without social-media features
   - Design with reusable frontend architecture for future API integration
   - Support Nigeria-first commerce assumptions while staying ready for expansion
   - Model a realistic marketplace and seller/admin flow for future backend implementation

   ## Tech stack

   This prototype is built with:

   - HTML
   - CSS
   - JavaScript
   - Tailwind CSS via CDN
   - Browser-based localStorage for demo state

   The current implementation is intentionally frontend-first and mock-data-driven, in line with the project’s staged strategy.

   ## Project structure

   ```text
   ANILyfe/
   ├── admin/
   ├── assets/
   ├── css/
   ├── data/
   ├── js/
   ├── pages/
   ├── index.html
   ├── README.md
   └── logo.png
   ```

   ### Main folders

   - `js/` — application logic, routing, mock data, marketplace flows, seller/admin views
   - `css/` — styling and responsive design system
   - `data/` — mock data placeholders and seeded marketplace data
   - `pages/` — route shells for direct access to sections of the app
   - `admin/` — admin-facing entry points
   - `assets/` — static media and future branding assets

   ## Routing model

   The app uses hash routing and renders views into a single SPA shell.

   Example routes:

   - `#/` — landing page
   - `#/marketplace` — marketplace home
   - `#/product/:id` — product detail
   - `#/seller/:id` — seller storefront
   - `#/auth` — buyer/seller auth flow
   - `#/wishlist` — saved products
   - `#/cart` — cart
   - `#/checkout` — checkout
   - `#/orders` — buyer orders
   - `#/help` — support center
   - `#/faq` — frequently asked questions
   - `#/shipping` — shipping information
   - `#/returns` — returns and refunds
   - `#/privacy` — privacy policy
   - `#/terms` — terms of service
   - `#/contact` — contact support
   - `#/admin-login` — admin login

   ## Getting started

   ### Option 1: Local static server

   ```bash
   cd ANILyfe
   python -m http.server 8080
   ```

   Then open:

   ```text
   http://localhost:8080/
   ```

   ### Option 2: Open directly

   You can also open `index.html` in a browser, though a local server is recommended for cleaner behavior and easier future integration with JSON/API data.

   ## Mock data and future architecture

   The application currently uses browser `localStorage` and structured mock data for a realistic prototype experience. This design is intentionally shaped to be replaced later by backend APIs without rebuilding the presentation layer.

   The project is organized so the UI can evolve into:

   ```text
   Frontend UI
     ↓
   API Layer
     ↓
   Backend Services
     ↓
   Database
     ↓
   Authentication / Payments / Orders / Inventory
   ```

   ## Notes on status

   This is a frontend prototype for a real marketplace product. It includes representative flows and polished UI but does not yet include production-grade security, payment processing, real backend logic, or live database integration.

   Key prototype assumptions include:

   - localStorage-backed state
   - mock product and seller data
   - demo authorization patterns
   - simulated admin and seller approval flows
   - frontend validation only

   These are intentionally marked as prototype features and should be replaced with real backend enforcement before launch.

   ## Future roadmap

   Planned evolution for the project includes:

   - Real API integration
   - Secure authentication and permission enforcement
   - Payment gateway integration with Paystack and Flutterwave-ready architecture
   - Seller payout and commission logic
   - Inventory validation and order workflows
   - Rating/review moderation and reporting
   - Advanced admin controls and audit trails
   - Scalable multi-country and multi-currency expansion

   ## License

   This project is provided for development and prototype purposes. Update this section if you plan to publish it under a specific open-source or commercial license.

   ## Support

   For follow-up implementation, this project is ready for:

   - UI refinement and visual polish
   - additional marketplace pages and checkout depth
   - seller/admin workflow expansion
   - real backend integration
   - deployment preparation
